## Albuquerque, NM

### Great places to eat


### Fun things to do

Visit Sandia Peak
- Take the Sandia Peak Tramway to the top of the Sandia Mountains.
- Bring hiking shoes and a warm jacket to hike along the Crest Trail, even in the summer.
- The former High Finance restaurant at the top of the mountain is to be replaced in 2018, so I'm not sure what food is available at the top of the mountain now.
